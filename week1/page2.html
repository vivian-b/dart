   <h1>DART 349: INTRODUCTION TO WEB DESIGN</h1>
   <h2><a href="index.html">Website Review </a></h2> 

<a href="page1.html"><p>Website 1</p></a>
<a href="page2.html"><p>Website 2 *</p></a>
<a href="page3.html"><p>Website 3</p></a>
<br>
<h3>Website 2:</h3>
<p> <a href="https://creative.family/en  " target="_blank">creative.family/en</a> </p>
<p>“Family is a digital agency that creating effective, remarkable & relevant digital for brands”
</p>

<p><h4>design:</h4> The contrast and bold style of the website makes the website style very appealing and showcases the vibe of the agency.
</p>
<p><h4>usability:</h4> The disappearance of the navigation bar is thoughtful in the cases of scrolling through the site, <br> but annoying when the user must make an action before being able to interact with it ( have to scroll up to bring the nav bar down)
</p>
<p><h4>content:</h4> The information is straightforward and easy to digest (home page). The cases are also neatly presented and informative.
</p>
<p><h4>creativity:</h4> The stylization is not unique, but the interactive elements gave some fun unexpected surprises.
