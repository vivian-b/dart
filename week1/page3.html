   <h1>DART 349: INTRODUCTION TO WEB DESIGN</h1>
   <h2><a href="index.html">Website Review </a></h2> 

<a href="page1.html"><p>Website 1</p></a>

<br>

<h3>Website 3:</h3>
<p> <a href="https://www.garethfuller.com/" target="_blank">garethfuller.com </a></p>
  <p>“An insight into the mind and works of Gareth Fuller — an artist and explorer.”</p> 
<p><h4>design:</h4> A nice thematic and fitting styling to the environment of the website. Has a dynamic feeling thanks <br>to the positioning and the visual shape of the content and animations/effects. (blurring, zooming)
</p>
<p><h4>usability:</h4> Easy navigation with straightforward destinations. However a lot of scrolling when considering <br>finding smaller information or looking through the selection of works.
</p>
<p><h4>content:</h4> The information presented is formal and quite lengthy. The individual showcases for the <br>artwork is very informative and interesting.
</p>
<p><h4>creativity:</h4> The horizontal scrolling, story-like navigation for exploring the artworks is very intuitive and engaging.
