<p><h4>design:</h4> The content is well aligned and spaced out. The color direction (focused on white/purple) makes the content <br> feel light and clean. The transition also makes the website feel very smooth.
</p>
<p><h4>usability:</h4> The storyline to explain the objective of the product is straightforward and easy to navigate through. <br>The shortcuts helps in outlining the overall website  and  jump to the specific content.
</p>
<p><h4>content:</h4> The imagery, the use of 3D perspective and the icons is coherent to the <br>content and makes the information more interesting and easy to grasp.
</p>
<p><h4>creativity:</h4> While the interactivity of the 3D background is not always expected<br>or common for websites, the overall design of the website is standard and not unique or surprising.
