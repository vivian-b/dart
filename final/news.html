                    <p>
                        A former FedEx employee killed eight people and injured numerous others at the facility in
                        Indianapolis where he used to work. While it has not been determined whether this was a hate
                        crime, four of the individuals killed were part of the Sikh community. </p>

                    <h2> Atlanta-area shootings</h2>
                    <p class="text-date">2021</p>
                    <p>
                        A white gunman claiming sexual addiction committed a series of mass shootings at three different
                        spas or massage parlors in the Atlanta metropolitan area on March 16, 2021. Eight people were
                        killed, including six women of Asian descent, and one other person was wounded. The shootings
                        caused considerable fear and outrage in the Asian American community, and that outrage was
                        further stoked when a Cherokee County sheriff’s deputy characterized the shooter’s actions as
                        being the result of “a really bad day.” The shooter has claimed that race was not a motivating
                        factor, and as of March 26, 2021, he has not been charged with a hate crime, though
                        investigators say they have not ruled out bias as a motivator, particularly given the
                        fetishization of Asian women in the US.

                    <h2> President Trump refers to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus” in a tweet</h2>
                    <p class="text-date">2020</p>

                    <p>
                        On March 16, 2020, President Donald J. Trump described the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” in
                        a tweet. Other US government officials used similar language in describing the virus despite
                        World Health Organization warnings against linking the virus to any area or group due to the
                        risk of stigmatization. The prevalence of this language in talking about the virus contributed
                        to anti-Asian sentiment and a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. In addition, a recent
                        Gallup poll (Feb. 3-18, 2021) finds that 45% of Americans now think China is the US’s greatest
                        enemy.

                <p>This project presents recent and old events relating to the Anti-Asian Hate movement to showcase the

            <p>This fictional website imitates a news outlet and focuses solely on events relating to Asian-hate. Hidden
                interactions are added to reflect the long-standing history of the issue that needs to be discovered to
                better understand the roots that led to the present day sentiments. Users are invited to travel around
                the page and discover the interactions and revisit the element that triggered such reactions.

                The blurring of the terms surrounding racism reflect how this issue is often swept under the rug and
                downplayed. The fading of the words Asia/Asian reflects how the community wishes to hide their identity
                because of the discrimination they face. </p>
