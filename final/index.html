                        Francisco to prohibit immigration of Asian laborers to the US. It was expanded and renamed in
                        1907
                        as the Asiatic Exclusion League, which promoted policies banning immigration and employment of
                        Asian
                        immigrants, created anti-Asian propaganda, and advocated for segregated schools.

                        cheered and looted Chinese stores and dwellings. The majority of the Chinese residents relocated

                    1913
                    The California Alien Land Law of 1913 (also known as the Webb–Haney Act) prohibited “aliens
                    ineligible
                    for citizenship” from owning agricultural land or holding long-term leases for it. As a result, many
                    California farmers of Asian descent (especially Japanese Americans) were forced to relinquish their
                    farms and moved elsewhere.
                    1917
                    Immigration Act of 1917: Building on the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Immigration Act of 1917
                    (also known as the Barred Zone Act), discriminated against persons of Asian descent, by creating a
                    “barred zone” extending from the Middle East to Southeast Asia from which no persons were allowed to
                    enter the US.
                    1921
                    Emergency Quota Act introduced the “national origins formula” by imposing quotas based on
                    immigrants’
                    country of origin, calculated at three percent of the total number of foreign-born persons from that
                    country recorded in the 1910 census. Its goal was to maintain the existing ethnic composition of the
                    US
                    and keep quotas low for Eastern and Southern Europe. The act did not apply to countries with
                    bilateral
                    agreements with the US or to Asian countries listed in the Immigration Act of 1917.
                    1922
                    Cable Act: Under previous law, women who were US citizens would lose their citizenship if they
                    married a
                    non-US citizen. This law enabled those women to retain their citizenship despite marriages to non-US
                    citizens. However, it did not apply to women who married “aliens ineligible for citizenship,”
                    including
                    Asian immigrant men.
                    Takao Ozawa v. United States: US Supreme Court upholds the Naturalization Law which declared
                    Japanese
                    and other Asian immigrants ineligible for citizenship.
                    1923
                    United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind: US Supreme Court rules Indians are ineligible for US
                    citizenship.
                    At this point, nearly all Asians were ineligible for citizenship.
                    1924
                    Johnson Reed Act (Immigration Act of 1924): Limited the number of immigrants allowed entry into the
                    US
                    through a national origins quota. The quota provided immigration visas to two percent of the total
                    number of people of each nationality in the US as of the 1890 national census. Included a provision
                    excluding any alien who by virtue of race or nationality was ineligible for citizenship. Even Asians
                    not
                    previously prohibited from immigrating (including people from Japan) would no longer be admitted to
                    the
                    US.
                    1927
                    Lum v. Rice: This case ruled that exclusion by race of Chinese Americans from public school did not
                    violate the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, effectively allowing the exclusion of minority
                    children from schools reserved for whites.
                    1927-1930
                    Anti-Filipino riots: Filipinos in Washington state, including Yakima Valley, Exeter, and
                    Watsonville,
                    were subject to extensive intimidation and violence by whites. The Ku Klux Klan exploited existing
                    anti-Asian sentiment that saw Filipinos as a source of inexpensive labor and a threat to white
                    women.
                    1931
                    Cable Act amended: American women could now retain their citizenship after marrying aliens
                    ineligible
                    for US citizenship, including Asians.
                    1933
                    Roldan vs. LA County: A California Appellate court found that the state's anti-miscegenation laws
                    did
                    not specifically bar the marriage of a Filipino and a white person. LA County officials appealed to
                    the
                    Supreme Court of California, who decided not to review the case. After one week the California State
                    Legislature voted to amend the code in question to ensure that Filipinos could not marry whites.
                    1934
                    Tyding-McDuffle Act (Philippine Independence Act): US federal law that established the process for
                    the
                    Philippines, at that time an American colony, to become an independent country. Reclassified all
                    Filipinos, including those then living in the US, as aliens in place of US nationals. A quota of 50
                    immigrants per year was established (though in reality the number was significantly higher as
                    agricultural corporations received exemptions to bring in Filipino laborers). This act also extended
                    the
                    Asian-exclusion policy of the Immigration Act of 1924 to the former territory.
                    1937
                    Anti-Alien Land Bill amendment: Washington State passed a series of amendments to their Alien Land
                    Bill
                    of 1921. Primarily targeting Japanese American agricultural workers, one of the amendments to the
                    law
                    clarified the definition of “alien” as meaning “non-citizens of the United States … who are
                    ineligible
                    to citizenship by naturalization.”

                    Shooting death of Fong Lee: Fong Lee, a nineteen-year-old Hmong young adult born in Laos, was
                    shot in the back while running from a Minneapolis police officer. The account of events was
                    disputed by experts, the family, and surveillance footage; two police officers stated that Lee
                    had raised a gun, however, the gun and bullets had no fingerprints or DNA, and initial police
                    records showed it was recovered from a burglary (and in their custody). A jury would find the
                    officer shooting did not use excessive force, sparking protests in downtown St. Paul. The
                    officer, after dismissal and union representation, returned to active duty. A 1989 shooting in
                    the back by police resulted in the death of two Hmong boys, both aged thirteen. These events
                    would later resonate in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd.

                    <h1>2012</h1>


                    Sikh Temple shooting: A white gunman with neo-Nazi affiliations went into a Sikh temple in Oak
                    Creek, Wisconsin on August 5, 2012, and started firing at its occupants. Six worshippers were
                    killed and three others were wounded. The shooting ended when a responding officer shot and
                    killed the gunman. Members of the Sikh community in Wisconsin were left in sadness and fear and
                    believed that this was a blatant hate crime on their community. The attack came amid a surge of
                    post-9/11 violence against Muslims or anyone perceived to be Muslim, including many South
                    Asians. President Obama and US Senator Mitt Romney released statements expressing their
                    condolences and condemning the senseless act of violence. Baba Punjab Singh, one of the three
                    survivors who was shot in the face and paralyzed, passed away almost eight years later on March
                    2, 2020.

                    <h1>2019</h1>


                    Asian Americans become the fastest-growing homeless population in San Francisco and Los Angeles,
                    but are severely undercounted and as a result, one of the hardest hit by a government crackdown
                    on homelessness during President Trump's administration. The homeless population avoids census
                    counts for fear of losing their children. They either stay long-term at motels or hide out in
                    single occupancy (temporary) housing programs. As they are not technically “homeless” while
                    staying in these temporary living situations, they do not count towards the total homeless
                    population, causing severe undercounting of the Asian American homeless. Plans for a shelter in
                    San Francisco were highly opposed by neighborhood protestors on the basis of “NIMBY” (Not In My
                    Backyard). The Trump administration faults “liberals” for the problem of homelessness in
                    California, with its only proposed solutions being clearing out homeless encampments and
                    criminalizing the homeless.

                    <h1>2020</h1>

                    President Trump refers to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus” in a tweet: On March 16, 2020,
                    President Donald J. Trump described the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” in a tweet. Other US
                    government officials used similar language in describing the virus despite World Health
                    Organization warnings against linking the virus to any area or group due to the risk of
                    stigmatization. The prevalence of this language in talking about the virus contributed to
                    anti-Asian sentiment and a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. In addition, a recent
                    Gallup poll (Feb. 3-18, 2021) finds that 45% of Americans now think China is the US’s greatest
                    enemy.

                    Transgender Asian Pacific Islanders face significant discrimination: A groundbreaking study
                    published in November 2020 by the advocacy group API Equality Northern California (APIENC) shows
                    that trans and gender-nonconforming Asian Pacific Islanders (APIs) face significant
                    discrimination compared to the general trans population. These disparities show up in housing,
                    employment, health, violence and harassment, policing and safety, and community and power.

                    <h1>2021</h1>

                    Atlanta-area shootings: A white gunman claiming sexual addiction committed a series of mass
                    shootings at three different spas or massage parlors in the Atlanta metropolitan area on March
                    16, 2021. Eight people were killed, including six women of Asian descent, and one other person
                    was wounded. The shootings caused considerable fear and outrage in the Asian American community,
                    and that outrage was further stoked when a Cherokee County sheriff’s deputy characterized the
                    shooter’s actions as being the result of “a really bad day.” The shooter has claimed that race
                    was not a motivating factor, and as of March 26, 2021, he has not been charged with a hate
                    crime, though investigators say they have not ruled out bias as a motivator, particularly given
                    the fetishization of Asian women in the US.

                    Indianapolis shootings: A former FedEx employee killed eight people and injured numerous others
                    at the facility in Indianapolis where he used to work. While it has not been determined whether
                    this was a hate crime, four of the individuals killed were part of the Sikh community.
