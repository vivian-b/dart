        <p>The four cardinal directions, or cardinal points, are the four main compass directions: north, east, south,
            and west, commonly denoted by their initials N, E, S, and W respectively. Relative to north, the directions
            east, south, and west are at 90 degree intervals in the clockwise direction.

            The ordinal directions (also called the intercardinal directions) are northeast (NE), southeast (SE),
            southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). The intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal
            direction is called a secondary intercardinal direction. (source: wikipedia)</p>
