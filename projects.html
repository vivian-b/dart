                        <p> AAH is a fictional news website focused on articles surrounding the topic of Anti-Asian
                            hate.
                            The website imitates a news outlet and focuses solely on events relating to
                            Asian-hate. Hidden interactions are added to reflect the long-standing history of the issue
                            that needs to be discovered to better understand the roots that led to the present day
                            sentiments. Users are invited to travel around the page and discover the interactions and
                            revisit the element that triggered such reactions. The blurring of the terms surrounding
                            racism reflect how this issue is often swept under the rug and downplayed. The fading of the
                            words Asia/Asian reflects how the community wishes to hide their identity because of the
                            discrimination they face.
